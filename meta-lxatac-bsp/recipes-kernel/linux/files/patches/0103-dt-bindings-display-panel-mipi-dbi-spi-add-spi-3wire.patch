Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: display: panel: mipi-dbi-spi: add spi-3wire
 property
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Some MIPI DBI panels support a three wire mode (clock, chip select,
bidirectional data) that can be used to ask the panel if it is already set
up by e.g. the bootloader and can thus skip the initialization.
This enables a flicker-free boot.
