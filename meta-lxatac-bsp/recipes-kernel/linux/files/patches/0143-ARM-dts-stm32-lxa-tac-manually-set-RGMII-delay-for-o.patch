Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: lxa-tac: manually set RGMII delay for
 on-board switch
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Without these entries the correct delays are still infered from the "rgmii-id"
phy-mode, but a warning is shown on boot.
Provide the delays that would be used anyways to silence the warning.
