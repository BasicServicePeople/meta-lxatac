Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: remove obsolete comment about vrefbuf supply
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The STM32MP1 includes an internal reference voltage generator and buffer, that
can be configured to supply a couple of different reference voltages.
During the design process we were not sure if we should use one of these
voltages or supply one externally.
We have now settled on using 2.5V generated by the vrefbuf so the comment
indicating that we are not sure yet became obsolte.
