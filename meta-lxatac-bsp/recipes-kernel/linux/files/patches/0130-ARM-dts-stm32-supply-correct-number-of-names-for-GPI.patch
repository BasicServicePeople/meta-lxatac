Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: supply correct number of names for GPIOI
 (12) for LXATAC
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The GPIOI peripheral is different from the other GPIO[A-H] peripherals in that
it does not have 16 lines but only 12. Supplying 16 line names results in a
warning being shown during boot
